# Credit_Card_Churned_Customer
This repository contains the code for a machine learning model to predict whether a credit card customer will churn. The model is trained on a dataset of historical customer data.

# The repository is organized as follows:
* <b>data/</b> contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.<br>
* <b>models/</b> contains the code for the machine learning models.<br>
* <b>notebooks/</b> contains the Jupyter notebook used to develop and evaluate the models.<br>
* <b>README.md</b> this file, which provides an overview of the repository.<br>

# To get started, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies using the following commands:
* git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/Credit_Card_Churned_Customer<br>
* cd Credit_Card_Churned_Customer<br>
* pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Jupyter notebook to develop and evaluate the models.<br>

# The notebook is divided into the following sections:
* Data loading and preprocessing<br>
* Feature engineering<br>
* Model selection<br>
* Model evaluation<br>

The model selection section compares the performance of several machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost. The model evaluation section evaluates the performance of the best model on a held-out test set.
I hope this helps!
